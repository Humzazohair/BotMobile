- `main.py`: Combines object detection, ultrasonic mapping, A*, and sockets.
- `object_detection.py`: Object detection code.
- `mapping.py`: Ultrasonic sensor mapping code.
- `astar.py`: A* pathfinding implementation.

## Key Features

### Advanced Mapping
The mapping solution uses ultrasonic sensors to create a 100 cm x 100 cm grid, where obstacles are represented in a 2D array. We applied padding around obstacles to improve safety margins and enhance A* pathfinding. Interpolation fills in skipped sensor readings, optimizing the sensor sweep for efficiency.

### Object Detection
We implemented object detection using Googleâ€™s Mediapipe library on the Raspberry Pi, with multi-threading for efficient image capture and processing. The system can detect objects in real-time, and data is communicated between processes using sockets.

**Hardware Acceleration:** While we used CPU-based processing, a GPU could significantly improve object detection performance.

**Multithreading:** Enabled parallel tasks for image capture and processing, improving system efficiency.

**Frame Rate vs Accuracy:** A medium frame rate balanced real-time performance with detection accuracy.

### A* Pathfinding
We implemented A* pathfinding with a Manhattan distance heuristic and added a turn penalty to minimize unnecessary turns. This allowed for smoother and more efficient routing, especially given motor issues that required fewer turns for better accuracy.

### Full Self-Driving
Our self-driving system combines object detection and ultrasonic mapping with A* pathfinding. Using multithreading and socket communication, the system dynamically adjusts routes to avoid both static and moving obstacles.
